# About

## What is Concentration?
Concentration is a memory game where a number of cards are arranged in a grid, face down. Each card has a picture or symbol on it, and the goal is to match pairs until there are no more cards left. While typically played using playing cards, it can also be played using a specific theme. The game can be played individually or against multiple players.
